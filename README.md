# backtester
An event-driven backtester

## About
This backtester is based on a guide written by Quantstart's [Michael Halls-Moore](http://www.quantstart.com/about-mike/) on how to write an event-driven backtester. Improvements to the code in the guide made by [Douglas Denhartog](https://github.com/denhartog/quantstart-backtester) has also been incorporated. The code has then been modified by me to actually run and include more features.
